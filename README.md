# Hi there, I'm Ben

I'm just some random hobby Programmer, I have 3 years of programming experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML, [Go][golang] and some minor experience in other languages, I love coding in my free time, especially if it's with other people, so hmu if you want to collaborate on a Project.

Over my rather short time in coding, I've made several projects, including, a rather high-functionality Discord bot in Python, after that I started learning JavaScript (Node.js specifically) and made another Discord bot. I'm currently working on [discord-cxx][discordcxx], a wrapper for the Discord API written in C++.

If you're looking forward to talking to me, write me on Discord (**Schmenn#1088**)
